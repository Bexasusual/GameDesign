# GameDesign
This is a 2D game used to exercise your Memoey and Direction Sense.
It used a third party Library--SFML.

You can download and modify the code at any time, or even publish it after improvement.

There are some insufficiencies. For example, you can't adjust the size of the window and
when the game show the rotation animation--when it comes to the last stepï¼Œif you click the window, 
it will continue to run but will not show the animation, in other words, it will show no response on the screen.
Then you will have to Exit Game.

You can try to solve this problem and change the way this game response to user.
You can set the response location by Proportion instead of Pixel, too. Then you can adjust the size of window.

If you have solved the first question, please contact me. I really want to know how the problem occured and how to solve it. Thanks.

That's all. Have fun.
